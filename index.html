The origin of the Thoroughbred may be traced back to records indicating that a stock of Arab and Barb horses was introduced into England as early as the 3rd century.Natural conditions favoured development of the original stock, and selective breeding was encouraged by those interested in racing. Under the reigns of James I and Charles I, 43 mares—the so-called Royal Mares</p>

                Tours are offered through Horse Country and can be booked at https://visithorsecountry.com/... or via 859-963-1004. Please use these contact details rather than contacting the farm directly. Tickets must be purchased in advance as there will not be any walk up sales available at the farm.
                
                Tours conclude in our visitors’ center which features interactive videos of our stallions.
                
                Please visit our Instagram, Twitter and Facebook pages for photos and updates on American Pharoah, Justify and our other stallions.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It was winner number 19 for Justify on Thursday when Prouver (2f Justify x Ready to Act, by More Than Ready) broke her maiden in her second start.

                Trained by Cherie DeVaux, the gray filly was rated nearly four lengths off the leaders in the one-mile turf race as she bided her time. That time came as she went four wide through the turn and seven wide in the stretch to chase down those horses in front of her.
                
                She proved to be determined to win with a late run getting her up by a nose just in time to be in front as they flashed under the wire. </p>
